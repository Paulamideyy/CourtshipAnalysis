JAABA and MateBook Data output analysis scripts 
The following scripts were used to automate the quantification of courtship behavior in Drosophila.
1) Ground-truthing analysis; comparison between manual scores, JAABA scores and a third software called MateBook.
 - Automates the process of counting the overlaps between scores from different outputs; to calculate classification metrices such as precision, recall and F1 score. 
2) Behavior index calculation 	 
3) Extract separate Fly1 and Fly 2 behavior from MATLAB to csv for several videos. 
4) Extract separate Fly behaviors in the format of t0 and t1s from MateBook for several videos.
5) Create behavioral raster plots
